# Project Labyrinth
Pair programming project by Thérèse Ånmark and Maria Westling. We built a labyrinth Game in Redux, fetching actions from an API and present them with directions for the player to follow. Styled using styled components.

## The problem
We built this using reducers and with components to show the possible actions. We did alot of googling and looked at old projects, stackoverflow and from this put together a workable Labyrinth. If we had more time we would have included lotties in the final product and done some additional styling.
